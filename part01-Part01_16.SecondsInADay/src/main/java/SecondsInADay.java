/*
 * 16. Seconds in a day
 *
 * Lesson: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-1/5-calculating/
 *
 * In the exercise template, implement a program that asks the user for the
 * number of days. After that, the program prints the number of seconds in
 * the given number of days.
 *
 * Earlier we learned to read an integer in the following manner:
 *
 * ```java
 * Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 *
 * System.out.println("Give a number:");
 * int number = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
 * System.out.println("You gave " + number);
 * ```
 *
 * Examples of expected output:
 *
 * Example run (you type the lines marked >):
 *     How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
 *   > 1
 *     86400
 *
 * Example run:
 *     How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
 *   > 3
 *     259200
 *
 * Example run:
 *     How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
 *   > 7
 *     604800

        // Write your program here
        System.out.println("How many days would you like to convert to seconds?");
        int days = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
        System.out.println(days * 24 * 60 * 60);

    }
